# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is a version control system that lets you track changes in code.
# GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories online.
# Git Bash is a terminal for Windows that allows you to use Git commands.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# They’re often used interchangeably. The terminal is the program you open, and the command line is the space inside it where you type commands.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# PowerShell uses its own scripting language and command structure.
# Git Bash emulates a Unix-like shell, which is better suited for Git commands.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Python is the programming language. Anaconda is a distribution that comes with Python and lots of packages. Conda is the package and environment manager included with Anaconda.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code is a customizable code editor developed by Microsoft. It's good for writing and running Python code.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding tool often used for data science. Jupyter Lab is like a more modern, flexible interface that can support multiple notebooks, terminals, and files at once.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# It represents the home directory on Unix-based systems (like Mac and Linux).

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path points to a file or folder from the root directory.
# A relative path points to a file/folder from your current location.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# It would try to delete the current directory itself, which can very dangerous but also helpful.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add = stages changes for commit
# git commit = saves staged changes to local repository
# git push = uploads your commits to the remote GitHub repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . stages all changed files in the current folder.
# git add <file> only stages a specific file.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status shows what’s been changed, staged, or committed.
# git log -1 shows the most recent commit.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning downloads the entire repository for the first time.
# Pulling updates your local copy with any new changes from GitHub.
